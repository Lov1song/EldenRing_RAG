        "Margitis a tough fight for melee users due to his aggressive nature and long combos with extended wind-ups, making it difficult to block all of his attacks. You will need to dodge roll most of his moves, blocking only when necessary to conserve stamina for counterattacks.",
        "Using theLone Wolf Ashescan help you attack alongside the wolves, allowing you to break his stance and staggering him for a critical hit. Keep up the pressure to trigger this more often.",
        "Having high HP can help you trade hits more effectively. Margit deals both Physical and Holy damage (indicated by his yellow glowing weapon effects), so wear armor and talismans that protect against both. Avoid armor that results in a heavy roll.",
        "Bait his attacks and only strike when you are sure that he has stopped attacking, as he can extend certain combos if you overextend. You will likely trade damage occasionally, but that's okay.",
        "Watch out for his leaping hammer attack — dodge roll towards him and land a hit or two during his landing animation. Avoid getting greedy; you can usually only attack once without taking damage, and doing so too often will result in you running out of consumables.",
        "Consider slottingAsh of War: Bloody Slashfor its quick, long-range burst damage, though it does cost some health. You should already have this Ash of War if you have completedKenneth Haight'squestline.",

        "Margitcan either be extremely aggressive or not, and there seems to be no in-between. If you can keep separation from him until he goes into a \"not aggressive\" phase, then you can attack him at range fairly easily for a short time, getting some free damage. Just make sure to watch out for his Blade Toss attack, so you don't get hit.",
        "You could try usingGlintstone PebbleorGlintstone Stars, as these are incredibly effective and efficient. Their cast times are in the mid-range, so be warned that you'll have to have proper spacing to use them. Additionally, it's not a bad idea to use a Shield in your off-hand to block in case of emergencies or after you cast, in case you cut it too close.",
        "You can use the Lone Wolf Ashes to create a distraction that can allow you to range him down in less than a minute, if you play it right. Wait for the wolves to gain his attention, then unleash spell after spell, making sure to pause when you gain aggro. This gives the wolves time to acquire it once again before continuing your barrage.",

Fortunately there are two attacks which give you a window to punish, then escape to a safe distance so that he won_t swipe at you. They are his big delayed overhead windup and his jumping attack where he lunges at you (not the one where he jumps super high with the hammer.) For the first attack, dodge into him and charge up a full R2, then run away to a safe distance. The second one doesn't give you enough time to safely land a charged R2 and run away before the knives potentially come out, so just give him a normal R2 instead. You can just bait out these two attacks over and over, and even though it's slow, you won't ever see that knife swipe and no-hitting him becomes very simple",

It would be awesome if a random commoner on the side of the road could just transform into Margit on a whim and jump your ass. Would make him that much more of an omnipresent threat, and it would make your final fight with him at the Capital way more climactic and awesome if you've had to fight him a bunch of times throughout the Lands Between already",

When he slams his cane down, he keeps his hand up while its being lifted. If you walk in close enough proximity when this is happening that's when he pulls out the dagger swipes. The reason his attacks seem endless is because these modifications can take place a lot more than you think, at which point he'll do his base attack right after.And as a matter of fact, his hand is oftentimes in a position to do another attack after he's already swung; he's being smart with the fact he can incant a giant-crusher and erdsteel dagger at will.",

However, I WILL say he is the hardest, most unfair boss for the point in the game when they are expected to be encountered.  And yes, I know you're not expected to beat him right away (even if the game leads you right to him if you're following its directions).  But he nevertheless is the earliest proper boss, even if you go exploring for a long time.  The only other boss that even comes close to that title is Ludwig from BB:TOH.  Endless chain attacks and untelegraphed combos make him and absolutely miserable slog that just feels like like when it's done.I'm a vet of the series so I'm familiar with a lot of From's tricks, but if I don't blame any newcomer who expected the rest of the game to be like this or harder, quit and felt like they wasted their money.",

Ignore this rule if you are confident you can learn his moveset. I got him at LVL 15 with only 3 tries (hihi let me flex)These 2 tips stay the same for all the enemies you will face. Just expect it to be a lot harder after this boss. Happy hunting :D",
        "So, I saw that some people has issues with this boss, and well, I can partially understand it, it completely gives the mood of how complex ER bosses are compared to DS ones, but jesus guys, is not that bad as some people make out to be. This, even on a RL1 run, its very approachable, so im gonna give advice.This not only applies to this boss, but on every boss of Elden Ring as well, and the boss design is not gonna change on the DLC, I highly doubt it.Well, first we want to know that bosses have weak or strong points where they are more or less aggresive, and do a different set of attacks depending of where you are.For instance, on case of Margit, he has an habit to attack way more in case you are in front of him. If you are on his left side though, which a lot of attacks lets you sneak him by, he is gonna have a harder time reaching you, giving you time to attack/heal/etc. Even some attacks will miserably fail if you walk to those weak points. Thats what people mean by positioning.Second is that their attacks will highly change depending on where you are, meaning that you can partially make them what you want them to do. Yeah , the complain of bosses being RNG its ridiculous knowing this. The feeling of rolling a dice its just due to misinformation, and I would recommend to analize the boss while fighting.Third is, to vary your attacks, R2 its for something and for some reason its heavily underutilized, when its the most effective attacks against big windows, even more than 2 R1 I must say. If you do this, not only you will do a very decent amount of damage, but adds an insane posture damage as well with a charged one. So you know how effective it is, I did Margit fight with the battle axe +0 (two handed) on less than 2 minutes! Having \"8000 hp\" doesn´t really matter if you know how to melt a boss fight health bar.I heard that ER has a bad way of teaching about these kinds of things, so as someone who knows completely this game and beat it on RL1, trust me, if you apply these advices, boss fights become night and day. Never feel overwhelmed, at the end of the day, hesitation its defeat.Wish you luck to everyone, and good hunting.",
        "Just tank his spectral sword and dagger attacks, those deal insignificant damage, also try staying behind/to the side to punish his tail swipe with a jump attack, or his dagger swing with any thing elseCatch flame melts him if you started as prophet btwAs for dodging its rly just trial and error, i would suggest getting a brass shield and get a habit of holding m2 against attacks youre unsure about dodging, you can also dodge while holding block either way so it doesnt punish you in any way",
        "If you decide to play this like a linear, story-driven game he's the first boss. The tutorial right before teaches you to block attacks with a shield, and the game already throws a boss that can't be blocked with any of the starting shields, and even if you're skilled enough to dodge everything, the range of his attacks is made so you can't safely roll out either.The first NPC you meet tells you to follow the guidance of grace, and for some reason Melina takes you to the roundtable if you get killed by Margit, not if you beat him, the game straight up rewards the player for dying.",

Out of all from software games elden ring has for me by far the worst bosses. Idk how anyone defends them to this end.
