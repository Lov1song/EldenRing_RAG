        "Margit, the Fell Omenis aGreat Enemy BossinElden Ring. This is an optional boss as players don't need to defeat him to advance in Elden Ring, though they do need to defeat Margit to advance toStormveil Castle.",
        "Margit, the Fell Omen is found inStormhillwhen players attempt to approachStormveil Castle. A non-boss variant can be found later again when approaching a stationary enemy slightly southwest of theOuter Wall BattlegroundSite of Grace in theCapital Outskirts.",
        "BattlegroundSite of Grace in theCapital Outskirts.Margit stands in the Tarnished's way to prevent them from approaching the Elden Ring, though his motivations are only explained in alater encounter.",
        "The Best Tips for Margit, the Fell Omen:",
        "Margitis a tough fight for melee users due to his aggressive nature and long combos with extended wind-ups, making it difficult to block all of his attacks. You will need to dodge roll most of his moves, blocking only when necessary to conserve stamina for counterattacks.",
        "Using theLone Wolf Ashescan help you attack alongside the wolves, allowing you to break his stance and staggering him for a critical hit. Keep up the pressure to trigger this more often.",
        "Having high HP can help you trade hits more effectively. Margit deals both Physical and Holy damage (indicated by his yellow glowing weapon effects), so wear armor and talismans that protect against both. Avoid armor that results in a heavy roll.",
        "Bait his attacks and only strike when you are sure that he has stopped attacking, as he can extend certain combos if you overextend. You will likely trade damage occasionally, but that's okay.",
        "Watch out for his leaping hammer attack — dodge roll towards him and land a hit or two during his landing animation. Avoid getting greedy; you can usually only attack once without taking damage, and doing so too often will result in you running out of consumables.",
        "Consider slottingAsh of War: Bloody Slashfor its quick, long-range burst damage, though it does cost some health. You should already have this Ash of War if you have completedKenneth Haight'squestline.",
        "The strategy for Magic and Ranged users is somewhat easier, thoughShortbowusers may have a harder time due to lower damage and lack of aShield.",
        "Margitcan either be extremely aggressive or not, and there seems to be no in-between. If you can keep separation from him until he goes into a \"not aggressive\" phase, then you can attack him at range fairly easily for a short time, getting some free damage.",
        "easily for a short time, getting some free damage.Just make sure to watch out for his Blade Toss attack, so you don't get hit.",
        "You could try usingGlintstone PebbleorGlintstone Stars, as these are incredibly effective and efficient. Their cast times are in the mid-range, so be warned that you'll have to have proper spacing to use them.",
        "at you'll have to have proper spacing to use them.Additionally, it's not a bad idea to use a Shield in your off-hand to block in case of emergencies or after you cast, in case you cut it too close.",
        "You can use the Lone Wolf Ashes to create a distraction that can allow you to range him down in less than a minute, if you play it right. Wait for the wolves to gain his attention, then unleash spell after spell, making sure to pause when you gain aggro.",
        "r spell, making sure to pause when you gain aggro.This gives the wolves time to acquire it once again before continuing your barrage.",

        "Smouldering with thy wretched flame of ambition.",
        "A cloak of ragged fur worn about the exposed body of Margit, the Fell Omen.",
        "Having slaughtered countless champions during the Shattering, the Fell Omen has become a horror to those who harbor ambitions for the Erdtree, or for Lordship.",
        "A Great Rune of the shardbearer Morgott. Its blessing greatly raises maximum HP.",
        "This Great Rune is the anchor ring that houses the base, and proves two things:",
        "That the Omen King was born of the golden lineage, and that he was indeed the Lord of Leyndell.",
        "Remembrance of Morgott, the Omen King, hewn into the Erdtree.",
        "The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader. Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.",
        "Though born one of the graceless Omen, Morgott took it upon himself to become the Erdtree's protector. He loved not in return, for he was never loved, but nevertheless, love it he did.",
        "Doll of a curseborn bairn from the Erdtree's royal line. Uses FP to unleash many wraiths that chase down foes.",
        "Omen babies born of royalty do not have their horns excised, but instead are kept underground, unbeknownst to anyone, imprisoned for all eternity.",
        "These memorial fetishes are fashioned in secret.",
        "A fetish bathed in golden magic.",
        "A fetish bathed in golden magic.Shackles were used to bind the accursed people called the Omen, and these ones were made to keep a particular Omen under strictest confinement.Though faint, the shackles still retain vestiges of power — enough to trap the once-bound Margit on earth, if only for a short time.",
        "Pitch-black armor thinly painted with dried blood. Worn by the Night's Cavalry who ride funeral steeds.",
        "The Night's Cavalry, who now wander the dim roads at night, were once led by the Fell Omen and were deliverers of death for great warriors, knights, and champions.",
        "His lines and voice-acting are good...until the terrible lines after he 'dies'. He gets defeated and disappears in a poof of dust after getting his bum handed to him, but he's able and allowed to keep crap-talking with magical voice for several annoying weird moments.",
        " magical voice for several annoying weird moments.Of all things, he says to fear the night, a line so bad that I think the voice actor is audibly struggling with it. Why would I fear the night?",
        "ly struggling with it. Why would I fear the night?And he'll \"brook\" me no quarter, that would be a scary threat coming from the victor not the loser.I'm sure some hangers-on will attempt to say that the bad writing is \"good\" because it shows he's a petty useless crap-talker, but since it ruins his respectable fearsomeness well-established before-hand and also the words are stupid, that's why it's bad writing.",

        "\"Margit put that f*cking stick down, go sit over there\" - Marika",
        "Is this Morgott’s brother? Why is his name Margit and he attacks you?",
        "Well... thou art of farting skill. Warrior poop must truly run in thy butt... tarnished.-the flatulent sunbrony",
        "Fun fact: if you kill the margit that spawns in altus and then quit and reload the game, the commoner spawns with normal attacks and killing it doesn't give any runes",

        " to a safe distance so that he won_t swipe at you.They are his big delayed overhead windup and his jumping attack where he lunges at you (not the one where he jumps super high with the hammer.) For the first attack, dodge into him and charge up a full R2, then run away to a safe distance.",
        "ge up a full R2, then run away to a safe distance.The second one doesn't give you enough time to safely land a charged R2 and run away before the knives potentially come out, so just give him a normal R2 instead.",
        "ly come out, so just give him a normal R2 instead.You can just bait out these two attacks over and over, and even though it's slow, you won't ever see that knife swipe and no-hitting him becomes very simple",
        "nightmare to no hit due to 5050 \"am i gonna dagger slash or not lol\" attacks",
        "For those who were curious like me, field Margit does not disappear if you kill Morgott first, unlike the actual Margit at Stormveil.",
        "it is my first playthrough ever and she only dropped 9000 runes at stormveil, did i do somehting wrong?",
        "so what does \"cower in fear of the night\" even mean or did he just say that cuz it sounded cool",
        "Gundyr teached me the importance of not being greedy and the basics of rolls and souls combat.Margit teached me that I should always be paranoid as to when Elden Ring bosses will truly stop attacking.",
        "My spirit ashes disappear before the fight starts.",
        "surprisingly difficult than Morgott to no hit with low dmg output",
        "Iudex Gundyr still the best tutorial boss",
        "I love the lore implication that Margit is an endgame-level boss who jumps weak Tarnished to kill them before they become too powerful. It explains why he's such a tough fight so early in the game.",
        " why he's such a tough fight so early in the game.Honestly I wish there were more random encounters with him throughout the game, like his fight outside Leyndell. It would be awesome if a random commoner on the side of the road could just transform into Margit on a whim and jump your ass.",
        "transform into Margit on a whim and jump your ass.Would make him that much more of an omnipresent threat, and it would make your final fight with him at the Capital way more climactic and awesome if you've had to fight him a bunch of times throughout the Lands Between already",

        "ke on Godrick Knights and Banished Knights with...reasonable success, then I faced Margit and got my skull, spine and ego crushed in about 30 minutes of attempts.Yeah I initially bypassed Stormveil entirely and truly got gud in Liurnia, only later returning to bonk Margit once and for all.",
        "y later returning to bonk Margit once and for all.I salute you, you glorious bastard!",

        "ing cheated me out of an interesting experiencing.Anyone else or is it just me?",
        "Fun fact: killing the king in the capital will let you skip this fight, as Margit is attending his funeral",

        "pening that's when he pulls out the dagger swipes.The reason his attacks seem endless is because these modifications can take place a lot more than you think, at which point he'll do his base attack right after.And as a matter of fact, his hand is oftentimes in a position to do another attack after he's already swung; he's being smart with the fact he can incant a giant-crusher and erdsteel dagger at will.",
        "I'm not saying he's the hardest, most unfair boss in the Soulsborne series. However, I WILL say he is the hardest, most unfair boss for the point in the game when they are expected to be encountered.",
        "the game when they are expected to be encountered.And yes, I know you're not expected to beat him right away (even if the game leads you right to him if you're following its directions). But he nevertheless is the earliest proper boss, even if you go exploring for a long time.",

        "n comes close to that title is Ludwig from BB:TOH.Endless chain attacks and untelegraphed combos make him and absolutely miserable slog that just feels like like when it's done.I'm a vet of the series so I'm familiar with a lot of From's tricks, but if I don't blame any newcomer who expected the rest of the game to be like this or harder, quit and felt like they wasted their money.",

        "I have a theory for why he's not as strong here as he is in leyndell: Maybe Morgott's power to create projections of himself as Margit is tied to the distance of the projection in relation to him, and because he is physically always at the foot of the erdtree, that would explain why a projection of him in limgrave wouldn't be able to stop a lowly tarnished with enough determination, but a projection of him just outside leyndell was able to stack the bodies of countless heroes, and even force Radahn to retreat acording to the intro cinematic (This is also reflected in gameplay if we consider how stronger he is at his ecounter outside leyndell).",
